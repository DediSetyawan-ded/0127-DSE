"But I must explain to 
you how all this mistaken idea o
f denouncing pleasure and praising pai
n was born and I will give you a complete ac
count of the system, and expound the actual teachings
 of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
 human happiness. 
No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
 rationally encounter
 consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
 pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, becaus
e it is pain, but because occasionally
 circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
 which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exe
rcise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But
who has any
 right to find fault w
ith a man who chooses to enjoy a 
pleasure that has no annoying consequenc
es, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
 resultant pleasure?"
